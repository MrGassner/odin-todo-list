# The Odin Project: Todo List

##Project was made with Javascript and Webpack

This project utilizes localStorage of the user browser to store the projects/tasks added by the user
All the modals used on the project are custom made.

To add a new project click on the plus(+) button on the top right corner and type a name on the middle of the modal
the (x) button on the to right corner delete the entire project, so be carefull.

Each task can be deleted by it self on the right button 

Obs. Only working on the computer for now. I've not done the mobile version yet
